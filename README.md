## Private Docker Repository

### Pushing our Docker Image into a private Registry on AWS.

#### Here are the steps to push a Docker image to a private registry on AWS:

Step 1: First, ensure that we have a Docker image that you want to push to the private registry. If we don't have an image, we can create one using a Dockerfile.

Step 2: Next, create an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to store your Docker image. We can do this by logging into the AWS Management Console, selecting the ECR service, and clicking "Create repository."

Step 3: Once we have created the repository, we'll need to authenticate Docker with the registry. We can do this by running the following command in our terminal, replacing <your-registry-url> with the URL of our registry:

    aws ecr get-login-password --region <your-region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-registry-url>

Step 4 : Now that Docker is authenticated with the registry, we can tag your Docker image with the registry URL. We can do this by running the following command, replacing <your-image-name> with the name of your Docker image and <your-registry-url> with the URL of your registry:

    docker tag <your-image-name> <your-registry-url>/<your-image-name>

Step 5: Finally, we can push your Docker image to the private registry by running the following command, replacing <your-registry-url> and <your-image-name> with the URL and name of our registry and image, respectively:

    docker push <your-registry-url>/<your-image-name>

Once the image has been pushed, we can confirm that it's available in your ECR repository by logging into the AWS Management Console, selecting the ECR service, and navigating to your repository.
